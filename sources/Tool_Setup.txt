===================================================================================================

#STEP I: Setup a Windows VM inside VirtualBox. Setup networking as host_only. [Note 2]

#STEP II: Download and Install Pre-requisites on each VM
  1. Python 2.6 (http://python.org) and the following libraries
     a. Python Image Library 1.1.7 (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
     b. Python Win32 extensions (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/)
     c. Mysql-Python connector library (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python)
  2. Software Testing Automation Framework - STAF (http://staf.sourceforge.net/)
  3. Install Virtualbox guest additions
  4. Install Web Browsers you want to test your web app in - Firefox, Google Chrome etc.

#STEP III: Download and install the following on the host machine. 
  1. Sun JDK 6.0
  2. Python 2.6 (http://python.org) and the following libraries
     a. Twisted - Python networking library (http://twistedmatrix.com)
  3. GCC 4.2 and OpenCV library (http://opencv.willowgarage.com)
  4. Apache-MySQL-PHP

#STEP IV: Download and setup WebDiff tool for each windows VM as follows:
  1. Extract the archive to C:\ such that the tool is in C:\WebDiff
  2. Enter the information about browsers and other configuration params in config.json
  3. Run the vm_setup.py script. [Note 3]
  4. Share a folder from the host(~/WebDiff/Screenshots) to the guest OS (S:/Screenshots).
  5. Grant privileges to the host machine by adding the following to C:/STAF/bin/STAF.cfg :
       trust machine <host_machine_name_or_ip> level 5
  6. Shutdown the VM and restart in headless mode with a big virtual screen size.
       $VBoxHeadless -startvm WinXP
       $VBoxManage controlvm WinXP setvideomodehint 1600 10240 16

#STEP V: From host machine, one can invoke the process as follows:
  1. Enter the information about the VMs in the host_config.json file
  2. Setup the website in the WebDiff/analysis folder on the web server (Apache). 
     Configure the database settings in util.php
  3. Run the host_run.py script (This script starts a proxy for the VM and captures information from it)
  4. Finally compile and run the analysis script in the WebDiff/analysis folder 

Notes:
1. The STAFProc daemon process should run on all machines. It is added to startup during installation.
2. We have provided instructions for Virtualbox. However, it should be easy to do the same with other 
   virtualization tools. 
3. The vm_setup.py script runs all browsers and finds the viewport area dimensions. While running this 
   script, permanently disable popups or alerts are thrown by the browser (e.g. default browser settings)
   You need to also run the a simple proxy (simple_proxy.py) if the color script is not located locally on the VM.
4. You can choose to install several windows VM if you want to test multiple versions of Internet Explorer.
   There are tools like IE collection that provide multiple IE versions, that one might consider installing.
